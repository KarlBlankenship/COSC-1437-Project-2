#COSC 1437 - Project 2 - Number Analyzer
Number Analzer will generate a defined amount of random numbers between a given range.
Each random number will then be checked to determine whether the number is any of the following...
Even/Odd.
Prime.
Circular Prime.
Perfect.
Square.
Cubed.
A chart is then generated in the output window and a text file indicating the status of
each number and each catergory.
